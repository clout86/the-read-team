Not ready for release. 

trial at your own err

need love2d, and 

```
local http = require("socket.http")
local ltn12 = require("ltn12")
local json = require("dkjson")

and for the metasploit module:
 
local mp = require("MessagePack")

```

there is also an optional sql-dep that is burried, but that function needs updating anyhow.

if you're not running it on the test net... well somethings are "hard coded" via variables to the docker test-net right now.

you will need bettercap running on the testnet as well as metasploit avail on port 55552 locally exposed from the test-net


over-reaching goals of the project; our praxis: 

    User Experience (UX): Make sure that the interface is intuitive. Since the project aims to be accessible, the design should guide the user through processes without overwhelming them with information.

    Educational Content: Provide context and educational materials. For example, when a user performs an action, you could offer a brief explanation of what the command does and what the expected outcome is.

    Safety Measures: Since the tool interfaces with powerful frameworks like Metasploit, it's crucial to have safety measures in place to prevent misuse or accidental damage.

    Progressive Difficulty: Start with simple tasks and gradually introduce more complex scenarios. This scaffolding helps users build confidence and knowledge as they progress.

    Feedback System: Implement a feedback mechanism that informs users of the success or failure of their actions, what went wrong if there was an error, and how to correct it.

    Community and Support: Develop a community support system where users can share experiences, help each other out, and contribute to the project.

    Gamification: Introduce elements like scoring, badges, or levels to motivate users and track their progress.

    Responsibility and Ethics: Teach users about the ethical use of hacking tools and the importance of permission and legality in penetration testing.
