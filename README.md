Not ready for release. 

trial at your own err

need love2d, and 

```
local http = require("socket.http")
local ltn12 = require("ltn12")
local json = require("dkjson")

and for the metasploit module:
 
local mp = require("MessagePack")

```

there is also an optional sql-dep that is burried, but that function needs updating anyhow.

if you're not running it on the test net... well somethings are "hard coded" via variables to the docker test-net right now.

you will need bettercap running on the testnet as well as metasploit avail on port 55552 locally exposed from the test-net
